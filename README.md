## System Overview
The High-Frequency Trading FPGA System is built on a modular architecture that allows for seamless integration of various components. The system consists of the following key modules:

- **TCP/IP Stack**: Implements the TCP/IP protocol for reliable communication with the trading infrastructure. It includes the Ethernet layer, IP layer, and TCP layer.
- **Order Matching Engine**: Performs real-time matching of buy and sell orders based on price-time priority. It supports advanced order types and multiple execution strategies.
- **Custom IP Core**: Accelerates specific processing tasks related to financial data. It can be customized based on specific algorithmic trading requirements.
- **Risk Management Module**: Validates trades and monitors positions to ensure compliance with risk limits and regulations.
- **AXI Stream Interfaces**: Enables seamless integration of custom IP cores with the rest of the system.

## Architecture
The architecture of the High-Frequency Trading FPGA System is designed to optimize for low latency and high throughput. The system utilizes a pipelined architecture to achieve maximum performance.

The data flow begins with the receipt of Ethernet packets through the Ethernet layer. The packets are then processed by the IP layer and forwarded to the TCP layer. The TCP layer ensures reliable, connection-oriented communication and passes the data to the order matching engine.

The order matching engine receives orders from the TCP layer and performs real-time matching based on the specified order types and execution strategies. The matched trades are then sent back to the TCP layer for transmission to the trading infrastructure.

The custom IP core can be integrated into the system using AXI Stream interfaces. It can perform specialized processing tasks on financial data to accelerate trading algorithms.

The risk management module monitors the trades and positions to ensure compliance with predefined risk limits. It validates trades before execution and provides real-time position monitoring.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To use and modify the High-Frequency Trading FPGA System, you need the following:
- Xilinx Vivado Design Suite (version 2020.2 or later)
- FPGA development board (e.g., Xilinx Virtex UltraScale+ or Kintex UltraScale+)
- Trading infrastructure and market data feed
- Knowledge of Verilog and FPGA development

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/muditbhargava66/High-Frequency-Trading-FPGA-System.git
   ```
2. Open Xilinx Vivado and create a new project.
3. Add the source files from the `sources_1/new` directory to the project.
4. Add the constraint file `timing_constraints.xdc` from the `constrs_1/new` directory to the project.
5. Set the target FPGA device and configure the project settings accordingly.

## Usage
1. Customize the parameters and configuration settings in the top-level module (`top_level.v`) to match your specific requirements.
2. Modify the custom IP core (`custom_ip_core.v`) to implement your desired processing logic.
3. Update the risk management module (`risk_management.v`) with your specific risk limits and monitoring rules.
4. Verify the functionality of the system using the provided testbenches.
5. Run synthesis and implementation to generate the bitstream.
6. Program the FPGA with the generated bitstream.
7. Integrate the FPGA system with your trading infrastructure and market data feed.

## Testing

### Testbench Hierarchy
The repository includes a comprehensive testbench environment to verify the functionality of the High-Frequency Trading FPGA System. The testbench hierarchy is as follows:

- `tb_order_matching_engine.v`: Testbench for the order matching engine module.
- `tb_tcp_ip_stack.v`: Testbench for the TCP/IP stack module.
- `tb_custom_ip_core.v`: Testbench for the custom IP core module.
- `tb_risk_management.v`: Testbench for the risk management module.
- `tb_top_level.v`: Top-level testbench for the entire system.

### Running Tests
To run the tests:
1. Open the testbench files in Xilinx Vivado.
2. Set up the simulation environment and configure the test parameters.
3. Run the simulation and observe the results.
4. Verify that the system behaves as expected and meets the specified requirements.

## Synthesis and Implementation

### Resource Utilization
After running synthesis and implementation, review the resource utilization report to ensure that the design fits within the available FPGA resources. Optimize the design if necessary to meet the resource constraints.

### Timing Analysis
Analyze the timing reports generated by Vivado to verify that the design meets the required timing constraints. Pay attention to the worst negative slack (WNS) and total negative slack (TNS) values. Ensure that there are no timing violations.

If timing violations are present, review the critical paths and optimize the design accordingly. Consider pipelining, register balancing, and other optimization techniques to improve timing performance.

## Deployment
To deploy the High-Frequency Trading FPGA System:
1. Connect the FPGA development board to your trading infrastructure.
2. Configure the network settings and ensure connectivity.
3. Program the FPGA with the generated bitstream.
4. Integrate the FPGA system with your trading software and market data feed.
5. Monitor the system performance and verify the trading functionality.
