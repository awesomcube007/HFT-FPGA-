## Architecture
The High-Frequency Trading FPGA System consists of the following key components:
- **TCP/IP Stack**: Implements the TCP/IP protocol for reliable communication with the trading infrastructure.
- **Order Matching Engine**: Performs real-time matching of buy and sell orders based on price-time priority.
- **Custom IP Core**: Accelerates specific processing tasks related to financial data.
- **Ethernet Layer**: Handles the Ethernet packet transmission and reception.
- **IP Layer**: Implements the Internet Protocol (IP) for packet routing and addressing.
- **TCP Layer**: Provides reliable, connection-oriented communication using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
- **AXI Stream Interfaces**: Enables seamless integration of custom IP cores with the rest of the system.

The system is designed with a modular architecture, allowing for easy customization and extension based on specific requirements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To use and modify the High-Frequency Trading FPGA System, you need the following:
